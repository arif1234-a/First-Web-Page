          We make Live, Push, Note, Move and Link — unique software and hardware
          for music creation and performance. With these products, our community
          of users creates amazing things.
        </h3>
          <p>
            Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live
            in 2001. Our products are used by a community of dedicated
            musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.

          Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when
          you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.
        </h3>
        <p>
          We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force
          behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make
          it for.

            We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided
            between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles
            and Tokyo.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
            use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural
            and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
            self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects
            us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge
            to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
            culture.

            <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

            <p> Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>

Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
